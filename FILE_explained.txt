App.tsx (Main Traffic Controller)
---------------------------------
Think of App.tsx as the traffic interchange for the whole site. It does three things:

1. Imports the map from `react-router-dom` so the app understands URLs like "/" or "/cpr" and the components that should appear there (Home, Modules, CPRTraining, HeimlichTraining, Achievements, plus the Header).
2. Inside `AppContent()` it peeks at the current location (`useLocation()`). On routes where a header should be shown (`/`, `/modules`, `/achievements`) it shows the Header. Then it sets up a table of routes so the browser knows exactly which screen to display for each URL.
3. `App()` wraps `AppContent` inside `<Router>`. The Router is the navigator that listens for URL changes and asks `AppContent` to update the visible page.

So App.tsx itself doesn’t display much—it tells the rest of the app which page component to load and whether the Header should be visible.

main.tsx (Switching the Lights On)
----------------------------------
`main.tsx` is the electrician that boots everything:

• It imports global CSS (index.css) and the 3rd-party scrollbar styling so every page can use the same look.
• Finds the empty `<div id="root">` in index.html.
• Uses `createRoot(...).render()` to mount `<App />` into that div, wrapping it in `React.StrictMode` for extra safety checks during development.

After main.tsx runs, the React app is alive inside your browser.

index.css (The Style Rulebook)
------------------------------
`index.css` is the shared wardrobe for the whole project:

• The first lines bring in Tailwind base/components/utilities. That means you can use Tailwind utility classes everywhere.
• CSS variables in `:root` define project-wide colors, shadows, and spacing tokens.
• It customizes scrollbars for Chrome/Firefox, so they’re slim and slate-colored.
• Sets base typography for the entire `<body>` (font family, smoothing, background color).
• Includes many reusable utility classes via Tailwind’s `@apply`, e.g., `.btn-primary`, `.card`, `.banner-box`, etc., so you can style buttons and cards consistently across files.
• Near the end it defines classes and keyframe animations specific to the floating “AI Training Assistant,” badge toasts, dropdowns, etc.

Because `index.css` is imported once in `main.tsx`, every React component automatically inherits these styles.

App.css (Legacy Starter Styles)
-------------------------------
`App.css` comes from the default Vite + React template. It sets a max width on `#root` and contains demo classes for a spinning React logo (`.logo`, `@keyframes logo-spin`) and a `.card` helper. The current project relies on Tailwind utilities instead, so these rules aren’t used anymore—they’re simply leftovers from the starter boilerplate.

Summary
-------
• `App.tsx` is the routing hub: it shows the right page for each URL and toggles the Header.
• `main.tsx` is the entry point that bootstraps React into the browser.
• `index.css` is the global style kit—colors, fonts, buttons, scrollbars, animations.
• `App.css` is legacy styling from the starter template (kept for reference, not actively used).

Achievements.tsx (Badge Cabinet)
---------------------------------
Purpose: Show the learner every badge they have earned (and what still needs work) by reading their saved progress from the browser.

1. Pulling saved progress
   • When the page loads, it reads two items from localStorage: one for CPR progress, one for the Heimlich module.
   • Helper `parseStoredJson` safely converts the stored text back into JavaScript objects. If the data is missing or broken, it quietly returns null.

2. Calculating badge status
   • Inside a `useMemo` block (think “only recalc when progress changes”), the code builds one master list of badges. Each badge knows:
     – Its name (“CPR Certified”, “Quiz Champion”, etc.).
     – A one-line description.
     – Which module it belongs to (overall, CPR, or Heimlich).
     – Whether the learner has earned it yet, based on the stored progress (quiz scores, completed steps, enabled reminders, etc.).
   • The list is then split into “earned” and “upcoming” groups for each module tab so the UI can show a proud “earned” section and a faded “locked” section.

3. Rendering the cabinet
   • A simple helper `renderBadgeSection` prints the badge groups: awarded badges sit in a grid, locked badges appear with a padlock icon.
   • At the top the page shows a quick summary of total earned vs total available.

Overall, this file is a big “read saved data → convert it into badge lists → show it nicely” pipeline.

Home.tsx (Hero Welcome Banner)
------------------------------
Purpose: Provide a single fullscreen welcome banner with two big buttons.

• It uses the router’s `<Link>` component so the buttons navigate without reloading the page.
• The entire screen is a grey backdrop with a centered “Save Lives with Confidence” hero message.
• The section uses Tailwind utility classes (e.g., `bg-white/30`, `rounded-2xl`) to get a frosted-glass look.
• Both buttons (“Explore Training Modules” and “View Achievements”) scroll to the top after navigation so the new page starts at the proper place.

This file is intentionally simple—just text, a background photo, and navigation links.

Modules.tsx (Course Selector)
-----------------------------
Purpose: Give the learner a dashboard of all available modules, along with their progress for CPR and Heimlich.

1. Reading local progress
   • On mount, it pulls CPR and Heimlich progress from localStorage.
   • Helper `getCprStatus` and `getHeimlichStatus` translate that raw data into a friendly status card (e.g., “Continue module” vs “Restart module”).

2. Rendering the module cards
   • Each card shows an icon, title, short description, and a button.
   • CPR and Heimlich buttons use the status from step 1 (and reset stored progress if the learner chooses “Restart”).
   • Placeholder cards (“Gun Violence Response”, “Domestic Violence Awareness”) just link to `#` but set the visual foundation for future lessons.

Tailwind classes supply the layout (two-column grid, hover transitions). No complicated state—just read storage and adjust the text.

HeimlichTraining.tsx (Four-Step Lesson)
--------------------------------------
Purpose: Walk the learner through video → key points → quiz → practice for the Heimlich maneuver while remembering their place.

• State overview: `currentStep`, quiz score/results, plus `useEffect` hooks that load/save progress to localStorage so leaving the page doesn’t lose their place.
• Badges: A helper list determines which Heimlich-specific badges are earned; small badge chips show progress under the title.
• Step-by-step rendering: `renderStepContent()` chooses the current panel.
  – Video: shows a placeholder player with a caution banner.
  – Knowledge: reveals key bullet points with large icons.
  – Quiz: single-question multiple choice, storing result in state.
  – Practice: simple encouragement message (this module doesn’t embed a 3D sim like CPR).
• Navigation buttons let the learner move forward/back through the steps, and state changes trigger localStorage updates so reloading returns to the same step.

In short: HeimlichTraining.tsx is a guided, persistent lesson with simple quiz logic and badge awareness.

CPRTraining.tsx (Feature-Rich Training Hub)
------------------------------------------
This is the biggest file—it manages the entire CPR journey: video, knowledge, quiz, 3D practice, badges, notifications, local storage, and chatbot sidebars. Here’s a tour:

1. Giant state toolbox
   • Scores of `useState` hooks track everything: which step you are on, quiz answers, bookmark settings, reminder toggle, simulation metrics (compression rate, counts), badge notifications, daily challenges, etc.
   • On mount it loads previous progress from localStorage (current step, quiz state, simulation data) so learners can leave and resume later.
   • A matching `useEffect` saves progress back to storage whenever those key pieces change.

2. Badge system & toasts
   • `cprBadgeGroups` groups earned vs upcoming badges based on current progress.
   • Another effect fires badge “toast” notifications the first time a badge is earned, auto-hiding them after a few seconds.

3. Step rendering
   • `renderStepContent()` chooses between four main experiences:
     – Video: embedded YouTube tutorial.
     – Knowledge: either a rich study guide or flashcards, depending on the learner’s selected study mode.
     – Quiz: multi-question quiz with feedback, score tracking, review analysis, and daily challenge info.
     – Practice: hosts the interactive 3D CPR simulation component plus coaching feedback.

4. 3D practice sidebar (SimulationInstructions)
   • Shows context-sensitive instructions, e.g., a progress bar requiring you to pan around the scene for 3 seconds, or buttons to retry compressions.

5. Layout & navigation
   • The page is split into a main content column and a sidebar (badges, chatbot instructions).
   • Navigation buttons at the bottom move between steps, while the top bar shows current progress.

6. Chatbot integration
   • `SimpleChatbot` is embedded on the side, receiving contextual props so the bot knows which step the learner sees.

All this makes CPRTraining.tsx the “control center” for the CPR module—managing persistence, practice logic, quizzes, badges, and supportive UI components.
